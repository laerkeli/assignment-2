### Assignment 2

#### A description of the purpose of the application:

The application uses google login to authenticate a google user. By requesting data from one of Googleâ€™s web services, you will be able to use your own Google Mail for logging in. The service will also be able to handle authentication and authorization in the long run. 

This application will be the foundation to our group project, where we needed to use Google Login to handle the students accounts from Sofiendalskolen.
